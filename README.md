SOURCE CODE: black_jack-main -> Program.cs

Known issues:
- ~~You only get aces, like i don't even know how i coded this in but its like 1am and i can't be bothered fixing it rn.~~
>Yeah so turns out there was proabably just some dysnc with the files and me changing the code back from testing took a while to upddate. So all good now :).
- When you get to many cards say more then 8 the formatting becomes completely fucked. Very rare cases so i won't bother fixing.
- When the dealer gets more then 3 aces, they stop deafulting to 1, also can't be bothered.
