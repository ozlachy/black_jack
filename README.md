black jack

EXE: black_jack-main -> bin -> Debug -> net6.0 -> BlackJack.exe
SOURCE CODE: black_jack-main -> Program.cs

Known issues:
- You only get aces, like i don't even know how i coded this in but its like 1am and i can't be bothered fixing it rn.
- When you get to many cards say more then 8 the formatting becomes completely fucked. Very rare cases so i won't bother fixing.
- When the dealer gets more then 3 aces, they stop deafulting to 1, also can't be bothered.
